# Everything Studio: The Universal Creative Workspace (Master Doc)

## ABSOLUTELY NEEDED (No-Go If Missing)
- **Agentic Assistant as Core:** Persistent, context-aware agent that helps with all creative tasks, remembers user/project context, and offers proactive, actionable suggestions.
- **Multimodal Workspace:** Users can create, edit, and combine text, images, video, audio, and music in a single unified canvas.
- **Jargon-Free, Frictionless UI:** No code or technical barriers—anyone can create, edit, and share without needing to learn syntax or workflows.
- **One-Click Suggestions:** The agent must surface relevant, context-aware actions (edit, polish, inspire, remix, share) with a single click.
- **Extensible Skills:** Agentic tools for ideation (JustImagine), drafting/versioning (JustDraft), and sharing/community must be available and integrated.
- **Unified Sharing:** Users can easily share finished works (any modality) to a social platform or export them, with attribution and remix/comment features.
- **Branding Consistency:** Montserrat font, color scheme (blue, red, green, slate black), and Everything Studio identity must be applied throughout the UI.

## Vision
A universal, agent-powered creative workspace where anyone can write, create, design, compose, and share—guided and empowered by an intelligent assistant. No code, no jargon, just pure creativity across all digital mediums.

## Core Principles
- **Agent as the Product:** The assistant is the centerpiece. It helps you write, create, edit, design, compose, and share. The workspace is the canvas; the agent is the collaborator.
- **Jargon-Free, Frictionless:** All features are surfaced through UI and agentic suggestions. No code, no blueprints, no technical barriers.
- **One-Click Suggestions:** The assistant proactively offers relevant, context-aware actions (edit, polish, inspire, remix, share) with a single click.
- **Universal Creativity:** For everyone: writers, artists, musicians, video creators, designers, teachers, students, and more.
- **Sharing is About Creations:** Users share finished works—text, images, videos, music, or combinations. Attribution to the assistant is optional.
- **Extensible Skills:** Specialized tools (drafting, ideation, versioning, remixing, editing) are available as agent-invoked skills, abstracted from the core creative flow.

---

## Modalities Supported
- **Text:** Writing, scripts, lyrics, essays, notes
- **Images:** Art, design, diagrams, AI-generated visuals
- **Video:** Clips, tutorials, storyboards, presentations
- **Audio/Voice:** Voice notes, narration, podcasts, music
- **Music:** Composing, arranging, editing, AI music
- **Workflows:** Templates for creative processes, collaborative flows, project management

## Extensible Skills

### JustImagine (Ideation & Inspiration)
- Agentic skill for brainstorming, creative prompts, remixing, and breaking creative block.
- The assistant can invoke JustImagine to help users generate ideas, explore new directions, or remix existing work—across any modality (text, image, audio, etc.).

### JustDraft (Drafting & Versioning)
- Agentic skill for managing drafts, revision history, and structured drafting flows.
- Lets users experiment, branch, and roll back creative work, with the agent offering suggestions for improvement or comparison between versions.

### Sharing & Community
- Users can share finished works (text, images, videos, music) to a social platform, with attribution to the assistant and remix/comment features.
- Community features are extensible and can be layered on top of the core workspace.

---

## Master Workspace
- Central canvas for all content types: drag/drop, embed, preview, and edit any modality.
- Agentic sidebar/overlay for suggestions and actions.
- Template gallery for quick project starts.
- Unified sharing & export for all creative outputs.

---

## Next Steps
- Clean up the workspace: Move all old docs, specs, and legacy product folders (e.g., JustStuffExt) into an `archive/` folder for reference.
- Update all branding and references to "Everything Studio" (two words).
- Design the new workspace UI for multimodal creation.
- Define the first set of templates and agentic workflows.
