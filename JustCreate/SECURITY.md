## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in JustCreate, please report it privately by emailing the maintainers or opening a security advisory on GitHub. Do **not** disclose security issues publicly until they have been reviewed and patched.

- We will respond as quickly as possible to all reports.
- Once the vulnerability is confirmed, we will take appropriate action and notify users as needed.

Thank you for helping keep JustCreate and its users safe!
