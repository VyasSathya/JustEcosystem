# JustCreate Ecosystem ‚Äì Master Documentation

Welcome to the JustCreate Ecosystem! This is the central hub for all documentation, architecture, and onboarding resources. The ecosystem consists of three interconnected VS Code extensions‚Äî**JustImagine**, **JustCreate**, **JustDraft**‚Äîthe optional social sharing service (**JustStuff**), and the robust backend infrastructure (**JustWorks**).

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Review the [System Overview](PROCESS/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md)** for a high-level understanding and dependencies.
2. **See [API Registry](PROCESS/API_REGISTRY.md)** for all backend and extension APIs and their implementation status.
3. **Track and manage work via the [Task Board](PROCESS/TASK_BOARD.md)**.
4. **Understand how documentation and implementation stay in sync in [Task & Documentation Flow](PROCESS/TASK_DOC_FLOW.md)**.
5. **Explore each [component](COMPONENTS/)** for detailed docs.
6. **See [JustEnglish](LANGUAGE/JustEnglish.md)** and the [CRA Process](LANGUAGE/CRA_Process.md) for the creative workflow.
7. **Understand the backend via [JustWorks Docs](DOCS_AND_TASKS/JustWorks_Docs.md)**.
8. **Follow the [Developer Onboarding Guide](ONBOARDING/Developer_Onboarding.md)** to get set up.

## üõ†Ô∏è Master Diffing, Dependency, and Task Delegation Process

- **Current Master Doc:** The latest mega document is always stored in [MASTER/CURRENT_MASTER.md](MASTER/CURRENT_MASTER.md). When a new master arrives, save it as `MASTER/NEW_MASTER.md` and run the diffing process.
- **Diffing & Propagation:** When a new master doc is introduced, automated scripts compare it to the current master, identify changes, and update all affected sections and dependencies in the documentation and task boards.
- **Dependency Awareness:** Each section in the Table of Contents lists its dependencies. When a change is made, all dependent sections and their tasks are automatically updated.
- **Task Delegation:** New or updated tasks in the master task board are automatically delegated to the relevant component/project `tasks.md` files. Each project/component board links back to the master and its dependencies.
- **Self-Healing Links:** If a folder or file moves, the system will self-correct all links in the README and other docs using relative paths and root-finding scripts.
- **Automation:** Use scripts (e.g., `generate_file_structure.py`) to keep the ToC, cross-references, and task delegation up-to-date. No manual link management is needed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Contribution Guidelines

- Keep documentation in sync with code and features.
- Use the provided scripts (e.g., `generate_file_structure.py`) for automated updates.
- Link all new docs from this README and the appropriate section index.
- For questions, consult the [Master Helper Chatbot](CHATBOT/Master_Helper_Chatbot.md).

## üìÖ Roadmap & Feedback

- See the [Development Roadmap](ROADMAP/Development_Roadmap.md) for milestones.
- Feedback and improvement suggestions are welcome‚Äîopen an issue or contact the core team.
