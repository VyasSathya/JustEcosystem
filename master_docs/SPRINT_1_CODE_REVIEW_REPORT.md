## üë®‚Äçüíª AI Engineer Task Review

### JustWorks (AI Engineer 3)
- **MASTER-010: Authentication System**
    - Status: Not Started
    - All sub-tasks (backend setup, endpoints, SSO, docs, tests, QA) are clearly defined but no progress yet.
    - **Review:** Must begin with backend repo structure and endpoint security (JWT/OAuth2, RBAC, input validation) before moving to integration and QA. No out-of-order dependencies.
- **MASTER-008, 013, 014, 015:** Not Started. No blocking for MVP flow.

### JustStuff (AI Engineer 2)
- **MASTER-016: Cross-Platform UI/Core Flows**
    - Status: Not Started
    - All mobile and desktop tasks must be done in parallel (as enforced in checklist).
    - **Review:** No progress yet. Must not proceed with mobile or desktop alone‚Äîparallelization is required. All feature and QA tasks must be tracked side-by-side.
- **MASTER-018: Viral Loops & Growth**
    - Status: Not Started
    - All viral features and QA flows are defined. No progress yet.
    - **Review:** Can begin in parallel with UI/core flows, but must integrate with auth backend as soon as available. No out-of-order dependencies, but should not launch viral flows without auth integration.
- **MASTER-004, 009:** In Progress (System research/diagrams). No blockers for MVP, but completion will help with architecture clarity.

### JustCreate (AI Engineer 1)
- **MASTER-012: CRA Loop Integration**
    - Status: Not Started
    - All integration, error handling, and QA tasks are defined. No progress yet.
    - **Review:** Should begin after JustWorks auth endpoints are available. No out-of-order dependencies, but can stub/test locally in the meantime.
- **Other tasks:** Not started, not blocking MVP.

## üö¶ Task Order & Coordination
- All teams are currently in pre-sprint (no tasks started).
- No tasks are being done out of order; dependencies are clear and enforced by checklists.
- JustStuff must ensure mobile and desktop are always developed/tested in parallel.
- Viral features (JustStuff) and CRA integration (JustCreate) must wait for auth backend to be available for full integration, but can begin stubbing/UX.

## üìà MVP Progress Bar
```
[‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë] 0% Complete
```
- All major tasks are ready for sprint start, but no sub-tasks are yet complete.
- Progress bar will auto-update as sub-tasks are checked off in each repo's checklist.

## üìã Summary
- All AI engineers have clear, actionable, and properly ordered tasks.
- No one is working out of order or blocked by missing dependencies.
- MVP progress is at 0%, ready to begin.
- Code review and progress reporting will continue automatically as work proceeds.
