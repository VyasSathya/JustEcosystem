## üî• Detailed Burndown by Task

### JustWorks: Authentication System (MASTER-010)
- [ ] Set up backend project structure and repo (JustWorks)
- [ ] Implement JWT/OAuth2 endpoints (login, register, refresh, logout)
- [ ] Add SSO and role management logic
- [ ] Write OpenAPI/Swagger docs for all endpoints
- [ ] Create integration tests for all clients (JustCreate, JustStuff)
- [ ] Manual QA: auth flows, error handling, edge cases
- [ ] Reference: QA_TEMPLATES/AUTHENTICATION.md

### JustStuff: Cross-Platform UI (MASTER-016)
- [ ] Build responsive layout for all core screens (feed, profile, publish) **(MOBILE & DESKTOP PARALLEL)**
- [ ] Implement device detection and adaptive UI (test on both platforms in parallel)
- [ ] Ensure feature parity (features must work identically on mobile and desktop, developed/tested side-by-side)
- [ ] Integrate with centralized authentication/API (validate on both platforms)
- [ ] Automated accessibility tests (WCAG 2.1 AA, run on mobile and desktop UIs)
- [ ] Manual QA: device/browser matrix (cover all major mobile and desktop devices)
- [ ] Reference: UI_AND_AGENT/JUSTSTUFF_MOBILE_UI.md, QA_TEMPLATES/PUBLISHING.md
- [ ] **NOTE:** Engineers and QA must coordinate so all features and tests are implemented for mobile and desktop in parallel, not sequentially. Cross-device bugs or parity gaps must be flagged and resolved immediately.

### JustStuff: Viral Loops & Growth (MASTER-018)
- [ ] Track and display remix counts, trending badges
- [ ] Implement invite/reward system (backend, UI, referral tracking)
- [ ] Push/in-app notifications for remix/like/share
- [ ] Launch first remix challenge and leaderboard
- [ ] Visualize remix trees (interactive UI)
- [ ] One-tap sharing and download for remixes
- [ ] QA: viral flows, metrics, abuse prevention
- [ ] Reference: UI_AND_AGENT/JUSTSTUFF_MOBILE_UI.md (sec. 11)

### JustCreate: CRA Loop Integration (MASTER-012)
- [ ] Implement VSCode extension UI for CRA loop
- [ ] Integrate with JustWorks backend API (compose, resolve, answer)
- [ ] Handle API errors and edge cases
- [ ] Automated integration tests (editor <-> backend)
- [ ] Manual QA: demo all flows
- [ ] Reference: QA_TEMPLATES/CRA_INTEGRATION.md

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & API Endpoint Notes
- All API endpoints (auth, remix, invite, notifications, etc.) must:
    - Require authentication (JWT/OAuth2, SSO)
    - Enforce role-based access control
    - Validate all inputs and sanitize outputs
    - Log suspicious or failed attempts
    - Reference: QA_TEMPLATES/AUTHENTICATION.md, backend OpenAPI docs
- Endpoint functionality must match blueprint and test scenarios exactly.

---

## üîÅ Recurring Sync & Update Workflow
- At the start of each sprint, auto-sync all checklists from `master_docs/TASK_BOARD.md` into each repo‚Äôs `.task/tasks/MASTER_SYNC.md`.
- Update this burndown dashboard after each major sub-task is completed (automated or via AI agent).
- No meetings: all progress, blockers, and updates are tracked in these markdown dashboards for full async, AI-native workflow.

**Sprint 1 is underway‚Äîtrack progress here and keep all endpoints secure and functional!**
