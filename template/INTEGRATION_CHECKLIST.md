# Integration Checklist Template

For every API integration (e.g., JustStuff â†’ JustWorks Auth):

- [ ] API contract (OpenAPI/Swagger) is published and linked
- [ ] Consumer client code is up-to-date
- [ ] Automated contract tests pass (CI badge or status)
- [ ] Integration smoke tests pass
- [ ] Logging and monitoring are in place
- [ ] Escalation/contact plan is documented
- [ ] Both consumer and provider sign off before downstream work

> Copy this checklist into your `.task/tasks/MASTER_SYNC.md` or use as a PR template for any new integration.
