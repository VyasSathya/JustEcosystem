# Technical Decision Log

This document captures all significant technical decisions made during the JustStuff project development. Each entry includes the context, alternatives considered, and rationale for the decision.

## Decision Format

Each decision follows this format:

```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] Decision Title

**Context:** Brief explanation of the problem or situation requiring a decision.

**Decision:** The specific technical choice that was made.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Alternative 1: Description and pros/cons
- Alternative 2: Description and pros/cons

**Rationale:** Explanation of why this option was selected over alternatives.

**Implications:**
- Positive consequences of this decision
- Potential challenges or limitations

**Status:** Active/Superseded (if superseded, link to new decision)
```

## [2025-04-15] UI Framework Selection

**Context:** Need to select a UI framework for developing the JustStuff social platform that enables rapid development of mobile-first interfaces.

**Decision:** Use React with TypeScript as the primary UI framework.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Vue.js: Good for rapid development but smaller ecosystem
- Svelte: Excellent performance but smaller community and fewer mobile components
- Flutter: Cross-platform but overkill for a web-first application

**Rationale:** React offers the best combination of community support, available component libraries, and ecosystem compatibility. TypeScript adds type safety which improves maintainability and reduces bugs.

**Implications:**
- Positive: Large ecosystem of components and tools
- Positive: Familiarity for most developers reduces onboarding
- Challenge: Bundle size needs optimization for mobile performance

**Status:** Active

## [2025-04-15] Styling Approach

**Context:** Need a styling solution that supports rapid UI development with mobile-first principles.

**Decision:** Use Tailwind CSS as the primary styling approach.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- CSS Modules: Good encapsulation but requires more custom CSS
- Styled Components: Component-scoped CSS but higher runtime overhead
- Material UI/Chakra UI: Pre-built components but less customization

**Rationale:** Tailwind provides utility-first approach that accelerates development while supporting customization. Its mobile-first responsive design system aligns perfectly with JustStuff requirements.

**Implications:**
- Positive: Rapid development with utility classes
- Positive: Small bundle size with PurgeCSS
- Challenge: Learning curve for developers new to utility-first CSS

**Status:** Active

## [2025-04-15] State Management Strategy

**Context:** Need an efficient state management approach for the application that handles local UI state, remote data, and real-time updates.

**Decision:** Use React Context API for application state, combined with SWR for data fetching and caching.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Redux: Comprehensive but verbose for simple state management
- MobX: Less boilerplate but more magic
- Recoil: Good atomic state but newer library with less adoption

**Rationale:** Context API provides sufficient capability for our needs without additional dependencies. SWR adds efficient data fetching, caching, and revalidation that will work well with our real-time requirements.

**Implications:**
- Positive: Minimal dependencies and bundle size
- Positive: SWR handles caching and revalidation efficiently
- Challenge: Complex state interactions require careful design

**Status:** Active
