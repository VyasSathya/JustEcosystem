# Documentation Management System

## Overview
The Documentation Management System is an integral part of the Just.cool ecosystem that manages all project documentation. This system is designed to work in conjunction with the Task Management System to ensure that documentation stays in sync with development activities.

## Documentation Organization
Documentation is organized into different categories:

1. **Master Documentation** (`master/`): System-wide architecture and design documentation
2. **Component Documentation** (`component_*/`): Documentation specific to individual components
3. **API Documentation** (`api/`): API specifications and usage guides
4. **User Documentation** (`user/`): End-user manuals and guides

## File Naming Convention
Documentation files follow a specific naming convention:
```
DOC-[CATEGORY]-[COMPONENT]-[SEQUENTIAL-NUMBER].md
```

Where:
- `CATEGORY`: ALL (system-wide), FE (frontend), BE (backend), etc.
- `COMPONENT`: Component name (e.g., AUTH, USER, ADMIN)
- `SEQUENTIAL-NUMBER`: A sequential identifier

Example: `DOC-ALL-ARCH-001.md`, `DOC-FE-AUTH-002.md`

## File Structure
Each documentation file includes a YAML frontmatter with metadata:

```yaml
---
id: DOC-ALL-ARCH-001
title: System Architecture Overview
status: current
version: 1.2
created: 2023-05-15
updated: 2023-06-10
authors:
  - jane.doe
relatedTasks:
  - TASK-001
  - TASK-002
---
```

## Documentation Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: New documentation is created when a new feature, component, or system is being developed.
2. **Updates**: Documentation is updated when related tasks are completed.
3. **Review**: Documentation undergoes review to ensure accuracy and completeness.
4. **Versioning**: Major changes result in a new version of the documentation.
5. **Archiving**: Outdated documentation is archived when it's no longer relevant.

## Status Indicators
Documents can have the following status values:
- `draft`: Initial draft, not yet reviewed
- `review`: Document is under review
- `current`: Document is up-to-date and approved
- `outdated`: Document needs updating
- `archived`: Document is no longer relevant

## Integration with Task Management
The `relatedTasks` field in the document frontmatter links the document to specific tasks in the Task Management System. This ensures that:

1. When a task is completed, related documentation can be identified and updated.
2. Documentation changes can be traced back to specific development tasks.

## Directory Structure

## Best Practices
- Always create or update documentation alongside development tasks
- Use clear, concise language for better readability
- Include diagrams where appropriate to illustrate concepts
- Link to related documentation to provide context
- Use consistent formatting and structure
- Reference specific code examples where relevant
- Keep the frontmatter metadata up-to-date

## Generating Documentation
The Documentation Management System includes tools to generate formatted documentation from markdown files for various purposes:

- HTML documentation for web-based viewing
- PDF documentation for distribution
- Integration with documentation platforms

## Documentation Review Process
1. Author submits document for review (status: `review`)
2. Reviewers provide feedback and suggest changes
3. Author addresses feedback
4. Document is approved and status changes to `current`
5. Document is published to the appropriate channels

## Versioning
Major changes to documentation should increment the version number in the frontmatter. The version history is maintained to track the evolution of documentation over time.
