# Task Management System

## Overview
The Task Management System is part of the Just.cool ecosystem that helps track, manage, and prioritize tasks across the project lifecycle. This system is designed to integrate seamlessly with our documentation management system to ensure that all development tasks are documented and tracked properly.

## Installation
No additional installation is required. This system is part of the Just.cool ecosystem template.

## Usage
To create a new task, create a Markdown file in the `tasks/` directory with the following naming convention:
```
[TASK-TYPE]-[SEQUENTIAL-NUMBER].md
```

Task types:
- `FEA`: Feature
- `BUG`: Bug fix
- `REF`: Refactoring
- `DOC`: Documentation
- `MIG`: Migration

Example: `FEA-001.md`, `BUG-002.md`

Each task file should include a YAML frontmatter with the following structure:

```yaml
---
id: FEA-001
title: Implement User Authentication
status: in-progress
priority: high
assignee: john.doe
created: 2023-06-01
updated: 2023-06-10
relatedDocs: 
  - DOC-ALL-AUTH-001
  - DOC-FE-AUTH-002
---
```

## Directory Structure
```
.task/
├── README.md                  # This documentation file
├── tasks/                     # Contains all task files
│   ├── FEA-001.md             # Feature task
│   ├── BUG-002.md             # Bug fix task
│   └── MIG-001.md             # Migration task
└── templates/                 # Task templates
    └── task-template.md       # Standard task template
```

## Status Indicators
Tasks can have the following status values:
- `not-started`: Task has been created but work has not begun
- `in-progress`: Task is currently being worked on
- `review`: Task is complete and awaiting review
- `done`: Task has been completed and reviewed
- `blocked`: Task cannot proceed due to dependencies

## Priority Levels
- `critical`: Must be addressed immediately
- `high`: Important for the current development cycle
- `medium`: Should be addressed after high priority items
- `low`: Nice to have, but not urgent

## Integration with Documentation
Each task can reference related documentation files using the `relatedDocs` field in the frontmatter. This ensures that tasks are linked to their corresponding documentation, which helps maintain consistency between implementation and documentation.

## Task Lifecycle
1. Create a new task file with appropriate metadata
2. Update the status as work progresses
3. Link related documentation files
4. Update the task when complete
5. Archive tasks when they are no longer relevant

## Best Practices
- Always create a task before starting work on a feature or bug fix
- Keep the status field updated to reflect the current state of the task
- Link all relevant documentation to ensure traceability
- Use clear, descriptive titles for tasks
- Include acceptance criteria in the task description

## Reporting
Task reports can be generated using the built-in reporting tools in the Just.cool ecosystem. These reports provide insight into the status of various tasks, helping with project management and planning.
