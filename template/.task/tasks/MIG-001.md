# VSCode Architecture Study

## Description
Conduct an in-depth study of VSCode's architecture to understand its extension model, communication patterns, and core component design for potential integration with the Just.cool ecosystem.

## Objectives
- Understand VSCode extension API and capabilities
- Analyze the communication model between extensions and the core platform
- Document the component architecture for reference
- Identify integration opportunities with our current system

## Success Criteria
- Complete architecture diagram of VSCode extension system
- Documentation of key APIs and interfaces
- Implementation proposal for Just.cool integration
- Prototype demonstrating basic integration capabilities

## Progress Updates
- **2023-07-15**: Task created and research begun
- **2023-07-18**: Completed initial analysis of extension API
- **2023-07-20**: Started work on architecture diagram and documentation

## Resources
- VSCode Extension API documentation
- GitHub repository for VSCode
- Sample extensions for reference
- Architecture whitepapers

## Notes
This task is a prerequisite for implementing the VSCode integration feature planned for Q3. The insights from this study will inform our approach to creating a seamless development experience within the Just.cool ecosystem.
